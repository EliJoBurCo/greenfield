# React Boilerplate Instructions

## Usage 
 `npm install`
 'npm run start' will run your live-server.
 'npm run build' will compile your jsx files into browser readable js files inside '/build'

### Server 

Start the server with:

```
npm run start
```

And see your app live at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Do your magic 

All your app files live in `app`.

Organize these however you want. You always can use `import x from 'xyz'` to react `app/xyz.js(x)`.

### Build 

Bundle your apps with its dependencies using:

```
npm run build
```

You'll get an `index.html` and an `app.js` file inside `build`.
