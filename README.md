# No bullshit :no_good::shit:

A React Webpack starter that doesn't get in your way.

Perfect if you need something very basic.
A simple experience that's to that of [`brunch-with-react`](http://github.com/brunch/with-react).

If you are only getting into React and know nothing about Webpack, and the word itself is enough to scare you, consider starting with **No bullshit**.
*(Or Brunch â€” [both are good starter options](http://goshakkk.name/you-dont-need-learn-webpack-first-with-react/), really.)*

If you're the *[almost]* clean slate guy, **No bullshit** is for you too.
It provides the minimal foundation that you can build atop.

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/goshakkk/no-bs-react-webpack-starter.git my-awesome-app`
2. `cd my-awesome-app`
3. `npm install`

### Server :bowtie:

Start the server with:

```
npm run start
```

And see your app live at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Do your magic :sparkles:

All your app files live in `app`.

Organize these however you want. You always can use `import x from 'xyz'` to react `app/xyz.js(x)`.

### Build :construction_worker:

Bundle your apps with its dependencies using:

```
npm run build
```

You'll get an `index.html` and an `app.js` file inside `build`.
