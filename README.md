## Usage

> TODO: add some usage instructions

## Requirements

- Node 5.xx.x +
- ReactJS
- Webpack
- (see `package.json` for details)

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Run Locally
```sh
npm run dev
```

NOTE: `npm run dev` will serve files at `http://localhost:8080/client/public/`, but `npm start` serves them at `http://localhost:8080/`.


### Deploy

Follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps) to configure your deployment server. When you're ready to deploy:

#### On your computer:

1. `git pull --rebase upstream master`
2. `git push live master`

#### On the server:

1. `npm install`
2. `webpack -p`
3. `pm2 start server/server.js`
    See [PM2's documentation](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/) for additional commands

#### If you're having trouble:

1. **Location:** Before running `npm install` on the server, make sure that you go to the working directory. e.g. if the server file lives at `/var/grocerybag/server/server.js`, go to `/var/grocerybag/` in the terminal.
2. **Process Manager:** Make sure that PM2 is installed globally. If not, run:

    ```sh
    npm install pm2 -g
    ```
