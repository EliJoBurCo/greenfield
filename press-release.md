# Greenfield Grocery List

### The Grocery List App
An interactive list app for tracking your grocery budget while shopping

> Grocery List is an app for creating and tracking your grocery shopping list. You will be able to create your list prior to heading to the store, or while you shop. Set a budget to compare to your total spent as you cross items off your list. Reference prior lists or create new ones, and base your budget off of past prices.

> Grocery List was created to help shoppers better track what they're putting in their cart. GL will help the customer stay on target with their budget, recall past purchases, and build future grocery lists. Also, GL can act as a safe-guard against mistakes at checkout. Double-check that there were no mistakes when ringing up your purchase.

> Grocery List allows the customer to see how much they have spent in real time. GL will keep track of the customers purchases and (if the users rates the product they purchased) how they felt about the purchased product. This will help the user create better, on budget, lists in the future.
