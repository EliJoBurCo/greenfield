# Greenfield Grocery List

### A Grocery List App
An interactive list app for tracking your grocery budget while shopping

>Grocery List is an app for creating and tracking your grocery shopping list. You will be able to create your list prior to or while you shop. Compare your budgetted amount to the total spent as you cross items off your list and put them in your shopping cart. Reference your prior lists as you create new ones, and base your budget off of past prices.

>Grocery List was created to help shoppers better track what they're putting in their cart. GL will better help the customer stay on target with their budget, recall past purchases, and build future grocery lists.

>Grocery List solves these problems by allowing the customer to see how much they have spent in real time as they check items off their list. GL will keep track of the customers purchases and (if the users rates the product they purchased) how they felt about the purchased product. This will help the user create better, on budget, lists in the future.
